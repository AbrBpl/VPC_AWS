Configuration in this directory creates set of VPC resources with VPC FLow Logs enabled and configured to push the logs to CloudWatch using a provided (ie. pre-existing) log group.

## Usage

To run this example you need to execute:

$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply

Note that this example may create resources which can cost money (AWS Elastic IP, for example). Run `terraform destroy` when you don't need these resources.
